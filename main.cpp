//create song
//song.getTitle()

//overloaded operations probably

//need something to represent albums and playlists

//remove(by id)
//date added in reference list
//date added in this list


//maybe have a unique file type to save song lists?
//could make a file class
//(or just save it in a txt file to begin with)

//fileInterface.h
//fileInterface.cc

//load (returns collection object from file object, file name)
//save (makes file object from collection object, file name)

//also an interface to create/read/write files


//finally the necessary 
//goes through spotify and makes a list of everything you need
